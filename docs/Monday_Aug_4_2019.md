The major problems I am still trying to wrestle with are enities not importing,
and filling out the entities that are relavent to my research. 

## Updating the Import again 

I loged in and ran 
``` php maintenance/importEntities.php --all-properties ``` 

I also ran some updates to select entities found through the websearch of wikidata.

## Links not being added to Entities 

[I found this old issue online](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T209803),
but I am not sure it is still related to the problem. Apparently this issue
was supposed to be fixed with a pull request, which I am sure was added to the
repo I pulled...at least, I think. 


## Editing Records 

Imported and edited records for Summa Izbu and Enuma anu enlil
