# Integrating Zotero API and Javascript

An initial concept was produced that brought in zotero's api. The most
difficult thing about this part of the project was keeping track of the GUI
controls and interacting directly with the DOM for Zotero's API. This would be
much better if I understood more about Jykell's templeting language or could
use a virtual DOM like in REACT or Vue.js. 

I am not sure how much I learned percisly in doing this. One thing I was
reminded of is how everything in javascript is an object. So I could create a
custom key for a button, and then call that when I need to return a link for
for the API calls. I am sure there is a better way to do all of this, but this
was an initial proof of concept.
