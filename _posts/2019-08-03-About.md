# Wikibase Creation For Assurbanipal's Library 

## Purpose 

The main question I have is: What can we derive from the way Mesopotamians
orgainized knowledge to better understand the way they understood how the world
worked, or even, what the world was? 

The two motivations for this question: 1) provide a better understanding to
the organazation of information for librarians and the history of library
science; and 2) develop a knowledge graph of Mesopotamian Canonical Text
Metadata and Persons which will provide a platform for answering this question
and others.^[By "canonical text", I simply mean the standard works for scribal
education, scholarly specification, and the non-archival documents found in
Assurbanipal's library]
